# Visiting Month Segment

This is the full code for [Productive Feature Abuse Chapter 1](https://liferay.dev/blogs/-/blogs/productive-feature-abuse) Blog article on using Segments for attributes that aren't strictly tied to a specific user.

## Build instructions

Clone into a Liferay Workspace's `module` directory and build.

* Tested with `liferay.workspace.product=dxp-7.3-ga1`. 
* *Should* work on Liferay Portal CE 7.3.5 (but not tested). 
* *Might* require adjustment in build.gradle dependencies for CE compatible build
